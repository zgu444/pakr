# Parkr

Parkr is an ECE capstone project done by a group of three: Zilei Gu, Hubert Yu, and Yuqing Ma.

Many new models of automobiles offer amazing parking assistance systems, distance detectors, back-up cameras, etc. While these features could greatly improve your driving/parking experience, many vehicles of older models don’t have the console system that’s compatible with this upgrade. Installing a back-up camera and radar system would often mean replacing the entire console and incur a much higher cost. In addition, even though there exist parking assistance systems on the market, there is a lack of clear instructions on how to maneuver the vehicles based on the spatial feedback. That's why we’re here to build an integrated parking assistance, Parkr, that provides useful and executable information to drivers through an Android app.

Our system will be able to detect distance through ultrasonic sensors and provide parking spot image through an Android App to the drivers. The distance detection system alerts the drivers when the vehicle gets too close to surrounding objects. The image on the Android App provides the driver with visual information on the relative location of the vehicle to the surrounding objects. In addition, Parkr provides real-time audio instructions on how to maneuverer the steering wheel.
